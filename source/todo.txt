How program should be organized:

main:
 handles exceptions that didn't get caught elsewhere.
 Runs other modules.

File Management:
 Files are originaly on an FTP server.
 Download those files.
 Check daily for new file; should be one per day.
 Those files are messy CSVs. Clean sufficient to bring into database.

Bring Files into database:
 Create connection.
 Copy in all files that haven't been brought in.
 There should be a table in the database that states which files have been cleaned/imported.
