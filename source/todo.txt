How program should be organized:

main:
 handles exceptions that didn't get caught elsewhere.
 Runs other modules:
  Every 12 hours run filemanagemnt
  If there are new files, filemanager will return a list of them. If so:
   Run analysis.

File Management:
 Files are originaly on an FTP server.
 Download those files.(use ftplib)(don't mirror, just copy in .csv files so we have local backup)
 Check daily for new file; should be one per day.
 Those files are messy CSVs. Clean sufficient to bring into database.
 There should be a table in the database that states which files have been cleaned/imported.

Bring Files into database:
 Create connection.
 Copy in all files that haven't been brought in:

Create geometries for newly copied data.
Calculate and update avgspeed columns for newly copied in data.

#run run analysis
#create run blocks

***The following should be looped a couple of times.  Ones that continue to change should be
*investigated by hand.***
#assign lines
#end point analysis
#broken run block analysis
#break multi run block analysis
